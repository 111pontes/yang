The follow jar file is a runnable jar which provides a java swing based application for compiling and navigating the logical tree structures provided by .yang files.

The following application uses the yangtools compiler stored in the Opendaylight YangTools project.

NOTE: This is a work in progress. 

To use: double click on the .jar to automatically run it using your installed java runtime (Java 1.7 required).

To compile .yang files:
	Drag and drop one or more yang files on the left hand side of the application to automatically compile the files. If compilation fails, a reference to the file will still be stored.

To remove .yang files:
	Right click a File or module to remove it from the tool.

To view details:
	Select node in the compiled tree on the left to see the details on the right.
