OpenConfig
=================

OpenConfig is a collaboration among network operators to develop a set
of vendor-neutral data models for configuring and managing a variety
of widely-used network protocols and services.  Models are
written using the YANG data modeling language ([IETF RFC
6020](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6020/)).

The data models in this repository are made available under the Apache
2.0 license (see the LICENSE file).  Since some models are intended to
be published in the IETF, participants must be willing to adhere to
the [IETF Note Well](http://www.ietf.org/about/note-well.html)
statement as well as [BCP 78](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp78.txt)
and [BCP 79](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp79.txt).
